# 🚣‍♀️ AiRowing: AI Rowing Technique Analysis System

**AiRowing** is an AI-powered system that recognizes and analyzes rowing movements in real time.  
It tracks and visualizes key motion metrics — such as leg, back, and hand movement phases — and provides feedback on rowing form and timing.

> ⚠️ **Work In Progress**: This project is actively under development. Core functions are working, but features are being refined and expanded. Stay tuned!

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Real-time rowing phase recognition (Drive / Recovery)
- ✅ Angle detection and visualization (e.g., knee, hip, elbow)
- ✅ Leg / back / hand speed graphs over time
- 🔄 Automatic detection of stroke transitions
- 📊 Minimum and maximum angle tracking per stroke
- 🧪 Feedback for inconsistent or improper motion
- 📹 Video input via webcam or pre-recorded files

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python + OpenCV
- MediaPipe Pose Estimation
- Matplotlib (for graphing)
- NumPy, CSV (for data handling)

---



## 🚧 To Do

- [ ] Stroke count & average rhythm tracking  
- [ ] Web dashboard / GUI output  
- [ ] Integrate with rowing machine sensors  
- [ ] Auto feedback generation (e.g. "Lift your elbows earlier")
